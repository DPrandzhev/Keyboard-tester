# Text Generator Web Application Documentation

## Overview

The Text Generator web application is a simple tool designed for testing typing accuracy. 
It generates random text, and users can type the generated text to see how accurately they can match it. 
This documentation provides an overview of the application's functionality, usage, and customization options.

## Getting Started

To run the Text Generator web application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `text-generator-app.html` file in a web browser.
3. Click the "Generate Text" button to generate random text.
4. Start typing the generated text in the input field.

## User Interface

The application consists of the following user interface elements:

- **Generate Text Button**: Clicking this button generates a new random text for typing practice.
- **User Input Field**: Users can type the generated text in this input field.

## Functionality

- The application generates random text from a predefined array of sample texts.
- Users can type the generated text in the input field, and the application provides real-time feedback on typing accuracy.
- Correctly typed characters are highlighted in green, while incorrect or missed characters are highlighted in red.
- The "Generate Text" button generates new text for practice.

## Customization

Currently, the application uses a fixed set of sample texts. To customize the app:

- Modify the `sampleTexts` array in the JavaScript code (`text-generator-app.js`) with your own sample texts.

## Troubleshooting

## Future Development

We plan to enhance the Text Generator app by:

- Adding the ability for users to add their own sample texts.
- Improving the user interface and styling.
- Text Highlighting: As users type, characters in the generated text highlight in green for correct keystrokes and red for incorrect keystrokes.
